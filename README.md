enter. Then, you should proceed to accept this many integers. Once you have accepted all of the
integers, find the sum and mean. Print these values for the user.

<br>  <b>Part II:</b> Rumor has it that George Lucas may use a “formula” to create all of those strange sounding
names you see in the Star Wars movies (Jar Jar Binks, ObiWan, etc.)
Write a program that allows users to see what their Star Wars name might be according to the
suggested “formula”, follow the steps below.
Prompt the user for the following information:
1. First Name
2. Middle Name
3. Last Name
4. The Town of their Birth
Print their Star Wars Name using the following criteria:
Star Wars First Name = first three letters of last name + first 2 letters of first name
Star Wars Last Name = first two letters of middle name + first three letters of town of birth
